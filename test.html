			Journey of <b>Apex</b> Footwear Limited started more than two decades ago, from the inspiration of leather business & later curving its’ way into shoemaking. As the largest shoemaker in the subcontinent, our company holds 15% share of leather footwear export in Bangladesh from $1.1 billion leather export. Shoemaking being a highly labor intensive job, our company is home to 5500 workers mostly women to make stylish leather shoes. Our shoe design inspiration is taken from latest international footwear trend. The influence is then converted to sophisticated leather shoes by in-house Italian & Taiwanese designers. Being a footwear giant, its’ our responsibility to be a role model in developing people and helping environment. Our core values is set with the belief of valuing people through continuous development & making a path for higher achievements.

		“APEX” means the peak or the zenith. Since 1975 we have strived to live up to our name.
